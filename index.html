            I am Rushil Shah, an undergraduate passionate in the intersection between physics, computer science, and
            machine learning. Currently, I am pursuing a double major in physics and computer science at MIT. A comprehensive
            list of experience can be found here.

            After watching many documentaries on the mysteries of our universe, I began my journey into physics during
            high school. Around the same time, I was also introduced to coding and was facinated how a few lines of code
            could solve many difficult and time consuming problems. However, it was in college where I first gained exposure
            to the intersection of physics and computer science which made me realize the versatility of computer science.
            I hope to continue this journey to unlock the full potential of computer science throughout my life.

            Over the past few years, I have written a variety of STEM handouts including school curriculum and olympiad
            preparation. I have decided to release some of the handouts that I have written and will release more
            as I polish them.

            It is closing in on the end of my freshman year of college. It has been quite the experience to say
            the least. The mix between academics, social life, and personal life has been something I have never
            experience before, and I am excited to spend the next 3 years at MIT. I decided to make this website
            to start my adventure into computer science. I have always been interested in physics, but not so much
            in computer science. However, after reaching MIT, it's come to me the necessity of computer science in
            everything, especially physics. As I work on new projects, I will put them on this website to highlight
            all of the cool things that computer science and physics can do. By the end of the semester, I want to
            make the website look cleaner, add a dark mode feature, and add some of the projects I have already done.
